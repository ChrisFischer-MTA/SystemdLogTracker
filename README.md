# SystemdLogTracker

Tracking systemd log (journal) and send them to discord. This is a fork from book000's SystemdLogTracker.

# Purpose

I am looking to adapt this into a more feature set discord integration and warning system for Video Game servers. At first, it should handle Rust, but I am looking to further generalize this to allow quick and easy integration with module devolopment.
